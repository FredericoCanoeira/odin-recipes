# odin-recipes

It’s a basic project to practice all of the HTML knowledge acquired. 
In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website.

The website consist of a main index page which have links to a few recipes. The website won’t look very pretty by the time.

This project is just to build my HTML chops.
