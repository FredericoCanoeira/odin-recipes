    <h1>Turkey and quinoa meatloaf</h1>

    <p>I always found turkey meatloaf to be quite disappointing. The flavor is usually lacking as well
        as the texture. Well, I have developed this version that has a great texture and a surprisingly 
        good flavor (my brother couldn't even tell that it wasn't beef)! The secret is the quinoa, which adds 
        wonderful texture and is much nuttier than breadcrumbs. I hope you enjoy this recipe!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
       <li>¼ cup quinoa</li>
       <li>½ cup water</li>    
       <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
       <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
       <li>1 large clove garlic, chopped</li>
       <li>1 (20 ounce) package ground turkey</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon hot pepper sauce</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
       <li>1 egg</li>
       <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
       <li>2 tablespoons brown sugar</li>
       <li>2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
       <li>1 teaspoon water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>

    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Bring the quinoa and water to a boil in a saucepan over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover,
        and simmer until the quinoa is tender, and the water has been absorbed, about 15 to 20 minutes.
        Set aside to cool.</p> 
        
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>    
    
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion; cook and stir until the
    onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for another minute; 
    remove from heat to cool.</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Stir the turkey, cooked quinoa, onions, tomato paste, hot sauce, 2 tablespoons Worcestershire, egg, salt,
    and pepper in a large bowl until well combined. The mixture will be very moist. Shape into a loaf on a foil
    lined baking sheet. Combine the brown sugar, 2 teaspoons Worcestershire, and 1 teaspoon water in a small bowl. 
    Rub the paste over the top of the meatloaf.</p>

    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    <p>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer
    inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Let the meatloaf cool for 10
    minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
